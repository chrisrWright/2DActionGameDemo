# 2DActionGameDemo
This is some scripting I have done that incorporates universal game elements as well as some original ideas.
I have included 2 videos. "EnemyTracking_HitStun.mp4" shows scripting for enemies to shoot at the player and also show the hitstun and knock back applied to the character. "MovingProjectile.mp4" show an idea of a moving projectile that is simultaneously controlled while moving. Also there are console logs that records player health.
